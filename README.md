<h1>Day 25 of the 100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp</h1>
<p>For the Day 25 challenge, I created a Guess the US State game where players have to guess all 50 states in US, which will be highlighted on the map. This is a culmination of the teaching points that were shared in the tutorial, including the following but not limited to</p>
<ul>
  <li>Object-oriented programming, specifically Turtle</li>
  <li>Pandas, Dataframe and CSV</li>
  <li>Conditional Statements: If and While Loops</li>
</ul>

> [!TIP]
> It's exciting to learn how database can be integrated with front-end development, specficially how Pandas (Database) and Turtle (front-end) can be implemented. To handle large database, I always found it easier to break it into smaller parts (e.g., seeing part of the dataset) and also checking the documentation to look for pre-made functions that can help to speed up the process.

<h2>Why am I doing this?</h2>
<p>I have learned python before in school but I hope to revisit some of the python concepts that I may have forgotten and at the same time delve further into python, especially in the field of data science and visualisation.</p>

<h2>You can join me too!</h2>
